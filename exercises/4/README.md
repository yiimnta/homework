## Goal

In this exercise, you're going to learn the concepts of [Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) with [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and [Authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) with [graphql-shield](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield). For the latter, you need an understanding of the "middleware" software pattern as defined by [express](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield). An implementation for [apollo-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) is [graphql-middleware](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-middleware).

Extend exercise [#1](../1), [#2](../2) and [#3](../3) with the new [objectives](#objectives).

## Instructions

1. Rebase your `main` branch on top of `homework/main`.
2. Refactor your current graphql schema to match the new [target schema](#target-schema).
3. Test-drive the following features:
  * Signup a new user with email and password.
    * Accept only passwords with a length of at least 8 characters.
    * Make sure the `email` address is not taken by another user.
  * Login as existing user.
    * Implement a `context` function and verify a [JWT Bearer token](https://jwt.io/introduction/) from the `Authorization` HTTP request header.
3. Do not commit common security mistakes:
    * Use [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords.
    * Do not check your JWT secret into version control.
    * Do not unnecesarily expose private information like `email` in the JWT.
4. Test-drive the following refactorings:
  * `write` a post assigns the authenticated user as author.
    * Unauthenticated requests throw an error.
  * `upvote` a post assigns the authenticated user as voter.
    * Unauthenticated requests throw an error.
5. PR Review:
  1. Review a pull request of another team.
   * Find at least 6 things (:star: from [Objectives](#objectives)) the other team did or didn't do.
   * Either "Request Changes" or "Approve" *do not just "Comment"*.
   * Suggest changes line-by-line in "Files Changed".
   * Link to your code review in the description of your own pull request.
  2. Request a review from another team

## Objectives

:star: For a successful rebase on `homework/main`.

:star: For an implemented `signup` feature.

:star: For a software-tested `signup` feature.

:star: For password validation.

:star: For unique email address validation.

:star: For not having security issues according to instructions.

:star: For an implemented `login` feature using JWT.

:star: For a software-tested `login` feature.

:star: For assigning the authenticated user to a post in `write` and `upvote` mutations.

:star: For requesting a review and reviewing another team's PR according to the instructions.

## Optional Objectives

:rocket: For software-tested authorization errors on `write` and `upvote` mutations.

:rocket: For authorizing read access on `User.email`:
  * Allows access only if `email` belongs to authenticated user.

:rocket: For authorizing `delete` mutation:
  * Only authors of a post are allowed to delete their own posts.

:rocket: For adding a fallback authorization rule:
  * Access is denied on all mutations and queries which are not explicitly white-listed.

## Hints

* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is an alternative to [unversal-hot-reload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/universal-hot-reload) in development.
* Use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load your `JWT_SECRET` from `process.env` or an `.env` file.
* If you need, you could use mock function [matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions#custom-matchers) to assert certain `dataSource` store functions have been called.
* You can use [resolvers merging](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/merge-resolvers/) to split your resolvers into multiple files.
* You coud use JavaScript [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) to ensure data integrity and set default values for posts and users

### Target Schema

```gql
  type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    votes: Int!
    author: User!
  }

  type User {
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è attributes `id` and `name` have changed!
    # `id` now represents a randomly generated string, similar to `Post.id`
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
    posts: [Post]
  }

  type Query {
    posts: [Post]
    users: [User]
  }

  type Mutation {
    write(post: PostInput!): Post
    upvote(id: ID!): Post
    # üöÄ OPTIONAL
    # downvote(id: ID!): Post
    # üöÄ OPTIONAL
    # delete(id: ID!): Post

    """
    returns a signed JWT or null
    """
    login(email: String!, password: String!): String

    """
    returns a signed JWT or null
    """
    signup(name: String!, email: String!, password: String!): String
  }

  input PostInput {
    title: String!
  }
```
